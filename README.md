# Examer

Examer is a simple tool to generate exams from a question bank. It allows you to practice for exams by giving you a random set of questions from a template.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/SeonerVorteX/examer.git
```

```bash
cd examer
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```

## Template

The template is a simple excel file with the following columns: question, option1, option2, option3, option4, option5, answer. You can add your own exams to the ./templates folder. The exam template should be in the form of a .xlsx file. You can use the Example.xlsx file in the ./templates folder as an example.
